/// Specifies that an app wants a particular permission.
///
/// But only if the app is installed on a device running Android 6.0 ([`API level`]
/// 23) or higher. If the device is running API level 22 or lower, the app does
/// not have the specified permission.
///
/// This element is useful when you update an app to include a new feature that
/// requires an additional permission. If a user updates an app on a device that
/// is running API level 22 or lower, the system prompts the user at install
/// time to grant all new permissions that are declared in that update. If a new
/// feature is minor enough, you may prefer to disable the feature altogether on
/// those devices, so the user does not have to grant additional permissions to
/// update the app. By using the `<uses-permission-sdk-23>` element instead of
/// [`<uses-permission>`], you can request the permission only if the app is running
/// on platforms that support the [`runtime permissions model`] in which the user
/// grants permissions to the app while it is running.

/// For more information on permissions, see the [`Permissions`] section in the
/// introduction and the separate [`System Permissions`] API guide. A list of
/// permissions defined by the base platform is available at
/// [`android.Manifest.permission`].
