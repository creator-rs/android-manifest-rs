/// Specifies a system permission that the user must grant in order for the app
/// to operate correctly.
///
/// Permissions are granted by the user when the application is installed (on devices
/// running Android 5.1 and lower) or while the app is running (on devices running Android
/// 6.0 and higher). For more information on permissions, see the [`Permissions`] section
/// in the introduction and the separate [`System Permissions`] API guide. A list of
/// permissions defined by the base platform can be found at
/// [`android.Manifest.permission`].
///
/// ## Note
/// In some cases, the permissions that you request through
/// `<uses-permission>` can affect how your application is filtered by Google Play.
///
/// If you request a hardware-related permission — `CAMERA`, for example — Google Play
/// assumes that your application requires the underlying hardware feature and filters the
/// application from devices that do not offer it.
///
/// To control filtering, always explicitly declare hardware features in `<uses-feature>`
/// elements, rather than relying on Google Play to "discover" the requirements in
/// `<uses-permission>` elements. Then, if you want to disable filtering for a particular
/// feature, you can add a `android:required`="`false`" attribute to the <uses-feature>
/// declaration.
///
/// For a list of permissions that imply hardware features, see the documentation for the
/// [`<uses-feature>`] element.
///
/// ## XML Syntax
/// ```xml
/// <uses-permission android:name="string"
///          android:maxSdkVersion="integer" />
/// ```
///
/// ## Contained in
