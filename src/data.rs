/// Adds a data specification to an intent filter.
///
/// The specification can be just a data type (the mimeType attribute),
/// just a URI, or both a data type and a URI. A URI is specified
/// by separate attributes for each of its parts:
///
/// ```xml
/// <scheme>://<host>:<port>[<path>|<pathPrefix>|<pathPattern>]
/// ```
///
/// ## XML Examples
/// These attributes that specify the URL format are optional, but also mutually
/// dependent:
/// * If a [`scheme`] is not specified for the intent filter, all the other URI attributes
///   are ignored.
/// * If a [`host`] is not specified for the filter, the port attribute and all the path
///   attributes are ignored.
///
/// All the `<data>` elements contained within the same [`<intent-filter>`]
/// element contribute to the same filter. So, for example, the following filter
/// specification,
///
/// ```xml
/// <intent-filter ...>
///     <data android:scheme="something" android:host="project.example.com" />
///   ...
/// </intent-filter>
/// ```
///
/// is equivalent to this one:
///
/// ```xml
/// <intent-filter ...>
///     <data android:scheme="something" />
///     <data android:host="project.example.com" />
///   ...
/// </intent-filter>
/// ```
///
/// You can place any number of <data> elements inside an [`<intent-filter>`] to
/// give it multiple data options. None of its attributes have default values.
///
/// Information on how intent filters work, including the rules for how Intent objects are
/// matched against filters, can be found in another document, [`Intents and Intent
/// Filters`]. See also the [`Intent Filters`] section in the manifest file overview.
///
/// ## XML Syntax
/// ```xml
/// <data android:scheme="string"
///     android:host="string"
///     android:port="string"
///     android:path="string"
///     android:pathPattern="string"
///     android:pathPrefix="string"
