/// Declares a single GL texture compression format that the app supports.
///
/// An application "supports" a GL texture compression format if it is capable of
/// providing texture assets that are compressed in that format, once the application is
/// installed on a device. The application can provide the compressed assets locally, from
/// inside the .apk, or it can download them from a server at runtime.
///
/// Each `<supports-gl-texture>` element declares exactly one supported texture
/// compression format, specified as the value of a `android:name` attribute. If your
/// application supports multiple texture compression formats, you can declare multiple
/// `<supports-gl-texture>` elements.
///
/// ## XML Example
/// ```xml
/// <supports-gl-texture
///     android:name="GL_OES_compressed_ETC1_RGB8_texture" />
/// <supports-gl-texture
///     android:name="GL_OES_compressed_paletted_texture" />
/// ```
///
/// Declared <supports-gl-texture> elements are informational, meaning that the Android
/// system itself does not examine the elements at install time to ensure matching support
/// on the device. However, other services (such as Google Play) or applications can check
/// your application's <supports-gl-texture> declarations as part of handling or
/// interacting with your application.  For this reason, it's very important that you
/// declare all of the texture compression formats (from the list below) that your
/// application is capable of supporting.
///
/// Applications and devices typically declare their supported GL texture compression
/// formats using the same set of well-known strings, as listed below. The set of format
/// strings may grow over time, as needed, and since the values are strings, applications
/// are free to declare other formats as needed.
///
/// Assuming that the application is built with SDK Platform Tools r3 or higher, filtering
/// based on the `<supports-gl-texture>` element is activated for all API levels.
///
/// ## Note
/// Google Play filters applications according to the texture compression formats that
/// they support, to ensure that they can be installed only on devices that can handle
/// their textures properly. You can use texture compression filtering as a way of
/// targeting specific device types, based on GPU platform.
///
/// For important information about how Google Play uses `<supports-gl-texture>`
/// elements as the basis for filtering, read [`Google Play and texture compression
/// filtering`], below.
