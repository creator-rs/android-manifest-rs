/// the tree are separated by periods `('.')`. For example, if the base name is
/// com.example.project.taxes.

/// Permissions like the following might be added:
///
/// * `com.example.project.taxes.CALCULATE`
/// * `com.example.project.taxes.deductions.MAKE_SOME_UP`
/// * `com.example.project.taxes.deductions.EXAGGERATE`
