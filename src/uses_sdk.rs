    /// targetSdkVersion the system may enable compatibility behaviors to
    /// ensure that your app continues to work the way you expect.You can
    /// disable such compatibility behaviors by specifying targetSdkVersion
    /// to match the API level of the platform on which it's running. For
    /// example, setting this value to "11" or higher allows the system to apply

    /// then the system will not allow the application to be installed. In the case of
    /// re-validation after system update, this effectively removes your application
    /// from the device.
    ///
    /// To illustrate how this attribute can affect your application
    /// after system updates, consider the following example:
    ///
    /// An application declaring maxSdkVersion="5" in its manifest is published on Google
    /// Play. A user whose device is running Android 1.6 (API Level 4) downloads and
    /// installs the app. After a few weeks, the user receives an
    /// over-the-air system update to Android 2.0 (API Level 5). After the
    /// update is installed, the system checks the application's maxSdkVersion
    /// and successfully re-validates it. The application functions as
    /// normal. However, some time later, the device receives another system
    /// update, this time to Android 2.0.1 (API Level 6). After the update, the
    /// system can no longer re-validate the application because the system's
    /// own API Level (6) is now higher than the maximum supported by the
    /// application (5). The system prevents the application from being
    /// visible to the user, in effect removing it from the device.
    ///
    /// ## Warning
    /// Declaring this attribute is not recommended. First, there is no need to set the
    /// attribute as means of blocking deployment of your application onto new
    /// versions of the Android platform as they are released. By design, new versions
    /// of the platform are fully backward-compatible. Your application should work
    /// properly on new versions, provided it uses only standard APIs and follows
    /// development best practices. Second, note that in some cases, declaring
    /// the attribute can result in your application being removed from users'
    /// devices after a system update to a higher API Level. Most devices on
    /// which your application is likely to be installed will receive periodic
    /// system updates over the air, so you should consider their effect on your
    /// application before setting this attribute.
    ///
    /// Introduced in: API Level 4
    ///
    /// ## Important
    /// Future versions of Android (beyond Android 2.0.1) will no longer check or enforce
    /// the `maxSdkVersion` attribute during installation or re-validation. Google Play
    /// will continue to use the attribute as a filter, however, when presenting users
    /// with applications available for download.
