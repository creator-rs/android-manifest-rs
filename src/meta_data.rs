/// A name-value pair for an item of additional, arbitrary data that can be
/// supplied to the parent component.
///
/// A component element can contain any number
/// of `<meta-data>` subelements. The values from all of them are collected in a
/// single [`Bundle`] object and made available to the component as the
/// [`PackageItemInfo.metaData`] field.
///
/// Ordinary values are specified through the [`value`] attribute. However, to assign a
/// resource ID as the value, use the [`resource`] attribute instead. For example, the
/// following code assigns whatever value is stored in the @string/kangaroo resource to
/// the `"zoo"` name:
///
/// ## XML Examples
///
/// ```xml
/// <meta-data android:name="zoo" android:value="@string/kangaroo" />
/// ```
/// On the other hand, using the resource attribute would assign `"zoo"` the
/// numeric ID of the resource, not the value stored in the resource:
///
/// ```xml
/// <meta-data android:name="zoo" android:resource="@string/kangaroo" />
/// ```
///
/// It is highly recommended that you avoid supplying related data as multiple
/// separate `<meta-data>` entries. Instead, if you have complex data to
/// associate with a component, store it as a `resource` and use the resource
/// attribute to inform the component of its ID.
///
/// ## XML Syntax
/// ```xml
/// <meta-data android:name="string"
///            android:resource="resource specification"
///            android:value="string" />
/// ```
